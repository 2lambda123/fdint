Git Branching Model
===================
I'm using the Git branching model described
[here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

How To Release a New Version
============================

When you want release a new version, follow these directions. First, create a
release branch by branching off of the develop branch (substitute in the
appropriate version number):

    git checkout -b release-1.0 develop

Next, bump the version number, if it hasn't already been bumped. From the root
of the git repository run these commands (again, substituting the appropriate
version number):

    echo "__version__ = '1.0'" > fdint/version.py
    git commit -am "bump version number to 1.0"

Now is a good time to install and test in a virtualenv, to make sure you
haven't missed any bugs:

    python setup.py sdist
    tar -xvzf dist/fdint-1.0.tar.gz

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    cd fdint-1.0
    python setup.py install
    cd ../..
    python -m fdint.tests
    cd fdint
    deactivate
    rm -rf fdint-1.0 venv

Go ahead and fix any bugs you find in the release branch, and we'll merge them
back into the develop branch later. Next, merge the changes from the release
branch into the master branch, and tag the release:

    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff release-1.0
    git tag -a v1.0
    git push origin master

Then run the following commands from the root of the git repository to upload
the release to PyPI:

    python setup.py sdist
    python setup.py register sdist upload

Now go to the github page to "create a release" and upload the 'tar.gz' file
from the 'dist' directory.

Congratulations, you're done releasing the new version of fdint!
If any changes were made during the release branch, merge the release branch
into the develop branch, and then delete the release branch:

    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff release-1.0
    git branch -d release-1.0
